				<p>Dear Mr. Contillo,
I am writing to apply for the Computer Programmer position with DiTech Industries. I am an CS Student with over 4 years of computer programming experience. In my current role as Computer Programmer for Wellington Technical Services I work daily to utilize computer programming language in the development of a number of technical projects and assignments.
I am up to date on all computer programming languages and terms and my data entry skills are fast and efficient. I am incredibly organized and very detail oriented; I rarely make errors and know what even a small mistake can mean to a project.My exemplary programming skills along with my dedication and professionalism make me a well-suited candidate for your Computer Programmer position. I am also a thorough communicator and work well as part of a team in addition to my ability for self-direction. I would be thrilled to be able to bring my skills and hardwork to DiTech Industries as a Computer Programmer.</p>
